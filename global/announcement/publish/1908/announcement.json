Numerous features, e.g. Quote Overview, Configurator, Opportunity Pipeline, and Product Catalogue have been re-designed to enhance usability and efficiency. MX also introduces a new, eminently flexible user interface (UI) framework, which enables customers to have a highly customized UI to support their special needs to the full extent.</p>\n<p>To serve our manufacturing customers better, which often require tight integration with their existing backend systems such as ERP, In Mind Cloud further enhanced its integration capabilities to support CRM and CPQ processes even better. Examples are a newly introduced account and business partner synchronization, supporting scheduled jobs for custom tables, as well as views and enhancements on the backend pricing integration. Another significant milestone for the integration is that MX now offers open APIs, which for instance allow the usage of MX&rsquo;s robust configurator and pricing engines in third party user interfaces, such as building e-commerce front-ends.</p>"

UI Widget &ndash; Task-driven Dashboards</strong></p>\n<p>Manufacturing sales processes often involve monitoring, reviewing and completing multiple different types of tasks, from recording a customer request, to quote negotiation and approvals, and to final order creation. There should be no delays due to miscommunication or overlooked tasks. System emails, reminders and notifications per task level help to keep all stakeholders informed. However, per-user or role level, it is still necessary to have a task-driven and personalized dashboard available to ensure all the assigned tasks are closely followed, in order to streamline especially cross-departmental processes. Such dashboards require to be highly tailored based on each user&rsquo;s role and the tasks assigned in the sales process.</p>\n<p>With the above considerations, MX introduces a highly customizable UI Widget feature which is part of MX&rsquo;s User Interface Framework. In MX, a UI Widget is a pre-built user interface control that performs a specific task.<br />Use case examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A table control that shows \"Open Quotes&rdquo;</li>\n<li>A table control that shows &ldquo;Opportunity in Quotation phase&rdquo;</li>\n<li>A graph control that shows quote header information, e.g. pricing date, currency and total quote amount</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\n<p>In our 1908 release, the UI Widget functionality applies to the MX homepage, which is the entry point for each user. It will be further extended to other application areas in the future. More task-driven UI Widget controls will be continuously added into the framework based on demand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Line Item Classic View</strong></p>\n<p>To improve the performance on the quote line item view, In Mind Cloud introduces the Classic Line Item View. This view can be enabled via a setting. It is optimized for desktop usage and supports all features of the responsive view. This new line-items Classic View can support rendering for 1000+ line items much faster than the responsive line item view and gives desktop users a much clearer overview of hundreds of line items.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/3-Define Similar Quote Check criteria.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/4-Similar Quote Check Result page.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote Overview Page Re-Design</strong></p>\n<p>To improve access to quote header information, the former Quote Overview and Additional Attribute views have been merged into a combined Quote Overview tab.

        "en": "<p><strong>1. Similar Quotes Check</strong></p>\n<p>Finding similar quotes, let it be by the customer, sales area, product or even product configuration is a frequently requested feature. Especially if your business model is more indirect e.g., via value-added distributors, who are involved in the same project, it becomes an essential part of the sales process to ensure a consistent offer and pricing for all distributors bidding for the same tender. Hence, it is critically important for sales representatives to have a holistic picture of the tender/project so that they can make informed strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>To cater to these use cases, MX introduces a Similar Quotes Check feature which provides very detailed capabilities to search for similar quotes. Users can search based on quote header data, quote partner functions, line items (i.e. products) and specific product configurations. The results are not only exact matches. They are ranked with respect to the similarity to the user search criteria, i.e. by the number of criteria a certain quote fulfills.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/5-Preference update for system by administrator.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/6-Preference update for users by administrator.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. Approvals directly from Email</strong></p>\n<p>Approvals are time-critical for providing an outstanding customer experience. Next to the task-driven dashboard mentioned above, MX introduces with the 1908 release a direct email approval functionality. Eliminating the need to log into the application it will speed up quote turnaround times. This feature also meets the latest standards on security to prevent misusage. A one-time link is generated that has an expiry time, which can be controlled by an administrator.</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>3. Pricing Scheme/Procedure Determination</strong></p>\n<p>A global organization needs a differentiated costing and pricing approach across regions or sales channels. To better support, our customers, In Mind Cloud further enhances MX&rsquo;s both internal and external pricing engines. With this release, MX can support multiple pricing schemes/procedures and determine the relevant one based on quote header attributes (i.e. sales organization, distribution channel, division, and document type) and the customer account selected. This has significantly enabled our customers to have much more flexibility to implement various pricing strategies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. Price Items enhancements</strong></p>\n<p>The &lsquo;Price Items&rsquo; concept i.e. a detailed cost and price beak-down, enables the customer to have complex cost and price calculations per line item. To further improve the usability of the cost and price breakdown, MX delivers the following changes with the 1908 release:</p>\n<p>&middot; Ability to show and change a price condition type&rsquo;s base unit and unit of measure</p>\n<p>&middot; Showing the condition type ERP ID on the Price Items screen</p>\n<p>&middot; Showing a pricing condition&rsquo;s status, i.e. active and inactive</p>\n<p>&middot; Ability to trigger ERP pricing from Price Items screen</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

The APIs are accessed via an OAuth based authentication. Consumers can register their systems with an MX instance and get a client ID using which the client will be authorized.

This is done to support customer-specific needs more efficiently.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HTML Audits for configuration engine</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>More HTML audits are made available for both configuration and pricing engine. In addition, the output structure and folder naming have been standardized.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplification of configuration rule creation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The user-friendliness of creating configuration rules has been increased greatly. Users do not even need to type and can perform the action by simple clicks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SPARQL drop/alternate for quote</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting from the 1908 release, there is little to no need for using SPARQL on the quote. Users can use IMCScript to compute documentHeaderPrice and itemHeaderTotalPrice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing scheme &ndash; Excel-based definition</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting from the 1908 release, users can download a pricing scheme in Excel format, make changes and upload it back into the system.

Also, it allows to easily compare costing and pricing schemes or to move them across tenants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. System Tasks Enhancement</strong></p>\n<p>MX already supported scheduled synchronization jobs for products and accounts from ERP. Now it further extends this capability to lookup tables, which can be used for various use cases to control application behavior. This has significantly further improved MX&rsquo;s integration and customization capability. Now, customers can synchronize customized data sets automatically based on scheduled jobs. This ensures MX always provides the latest data sets and business logic to manufacturing users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From the administration user interface, MX consolidates the previously separated product, account and report synchronization screens into a central screen to allow easy administration. MX also introduces a monitoring dashboard to show which tasks are running and which process units have completed their runs.</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/1908/17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Below is a summary of the types of tasks that are supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Sync Job: To sync accounts from ERP</li>\n<li>Delete Sync History job: To delete the Sync History (introduced in 1908 release)</li>\n<li>Product Sync Job: To sync products from ERP</li>\n<li>ERP Table Sync Job: To sync tables from ERP (introduced in 1908 release)</li>\n<li>Report Sync Job: To sync MX report data to external systems</li>\n</ul>"
