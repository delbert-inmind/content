Numerous features, e.g. Home Page, Account Overview and Opportunity Pipeline View have been re-designed to enhance usability and efficiency.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />To serve our manufacturing customers better, we have introduced a new task management capability to quickly create and distribute tasks, linking them to complex sales cycles in opportunities or when managing quotes for manufacturing-as-a-service.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />In Mind Cloud further enhanced its CRM and CPQ processes. Examples are newly-introduced visibility rules around accounts and contacts, editing sales text at item level, updating prices on change of additional pricing relevant fields etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/2002/Image 1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>"

Activities Management</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a sales-driven process, activity management is a central component to track each customer interaction and schedule upcoming activities that help a sales rep move a customer through the funnel. Highly productive and successful sales reps understand the importance of a properly defined activity management process, as it helps them to better understand a customer&rsquo;s interaction history, collaborate with their colleagues more efficiently and stay on top of important deadlines pertaining to a sales cycle. At the same time, Sales Managers gain important insights which can be used to further improve the sales process, coach other or onboard new sales reps. Just imagine your best sales rep leaving on one day over the other, and you need to enable a smooth handover.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Here at In Mind Cloud, we have made it a priority to bring powerful activity management capabilities to the manufacturing industry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />We are introducing a new activity type &lsquo;Task&rsquo;. A task can be a certain activity that needs to be carried out in order to further progress the sales cycle and basically comprises of a task description, a status and priority, a date or date range as to when this task is going to get executed, as well as a responsible for completing the task. The following figure represents a task object:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/in-mind-cloud/content/master/global/assets/images/2002/Figure 1-Task Object.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Figure 1:&nbsp;Task Object</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If a task is created in direct relation to an opportunity or a quote, the user can reference this task accordingly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, it can be referenced to an account. This immediately helps, for example, a sales team that is jointly working on an opportunity to understand the various activities that have been carried out already, or that are scheduled to get executed in the future.</p>"

A section allows an administrator to logically group widgets together. In the above figure, the section &lsquo;Insights&rsquo; combines new tile widgets that can be turned on through configuration. The tiles available with release 20/02 are:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><br />&bull; Quote Volume by Status (aggregating the volume of quotes of a particular status; in this example, the status is &lsquo;Pending Internal Approval&rsquo;).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><br />&bull; Current Quarter Pipeline (total volume of active opportunities that are expected to close within the current quarter).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><br />&bull; Total Pipeline (active opportunities that are neither lost nor won).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\"><br />&bull; Won/Lost Opportunities (comparing the % split between opportunities that are won or lost).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The homepage also occupies existing table widgets that have been delivered as part of a previous release.</p>"
